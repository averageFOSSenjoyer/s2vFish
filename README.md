# s2vFish
### Description
This is a Twofish Algorithm written in SystemVerilog
The top level design for the algorithm is datapath.sv
This also includes a NIOS SOC to demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm

### How to run
Simply clone the files and compile the design (both SV and C) in order to test it via NIOS

### Reference
Files under /ref contains software implementations of the algorithm to compare against the hardware implementation
